ParTI!
------

A Parallel Tensor Infrastructure (ParTI!), is to support fast essential sparse tensor operations and tensor decompositions on multicore CPU and GPU architectures. These basic tensor operations are critical to the overall performance of tensor analysis algorithms (such as tensor decomposition). ParTI! is formerly known as SpTOL. 

This is the ParTI!2 branch, which is a rewrite of the original ParTI!. Both ParTI! and ParTI!2 will be actively developed for a considerably long time.
